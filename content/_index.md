**Field notes from a software engineer documenting how AI tools are reshaping our craft.**

I fell into AI-assisted coding tools very recently (early 2025), because I was very skeptical about the hype. Now I'm so excited about them that I can't resist sharing my journey!

This blog is for practitioners who care about code quality, junior developers navigating AI-assisted workflows, and anyone curious about what programming looks like when the tools think alongside you.

## Is anything here AI-generated?

I use AI for this blog way less than I use it for my code.

I use it as an assistant to help me write and organize my thoughts, and to review my writing. But I care about keeping the words mine, even if sometimes that means less perfect prose.
