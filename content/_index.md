**Field notes from a software engineer documenting how AI tools are reshaping our craft.**

Through hands-on experiments and honest observations, I explore what changes when Cursor writes your functions and Claude debugs your tests. No hype, no doomâ€”just the messy reality of building software in transition.

For practitioners who care about code quality, junior developers navigating AI-assisted workflows, and anyone curious about what programming looks like when the tools think alongside you.
